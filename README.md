## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of Biological Sciences at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, engaged in research and extension activities in the fields of bioinformatics, microbiology, chemistry, biotechnology, general biology and molecular biology.

I am currently interning at Biogenetika in the Bioinformatics department, assisting with data analysis and processing on the Illumina website, generating reports, writing and editing Python scripts, patient registration, and other tasks.

I have participated in a scientific initiation project focused on studying the antimicrobial mechanisms of bioactive procyanidins from aÃ§aÃ­ seeds. Additionally, I developed a review research project aimed at inhibiting communication among multidrug-resistant bacteria using compounds from the red pepper tree.

As a professional in biology and microbiology, I have knowledge of good laboratory practices in analysis and research, as well as the ability to perform specific procedures following standard operating protocols (SOPs). I understand biosafety in the use, handling, and cleaning of materials and reagents and possess all the necessary competencies to carry out laboratory activities.

I have experience in generating and describing tabulated results and have prior knowledge of programming languages Python and R.

Here on my GitHub, I will cover topics related to bioinformatics, primarily using Python language. I am currently compiling my progress on solving exercises from the Rosalind website as a learning method.
